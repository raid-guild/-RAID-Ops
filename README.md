# $RAID-Ops

As part of the new RAID Token, we're experimenting with new models to incentivize and reward decentralized contributions.  The goal is to create a framework that enables anyone to step up into a "coordinator" position while also rewarding contributors for contributions that might have previously been uncompesated.
- The goal is that this leads for more consistency in contributions and less of a burnout in active contributors.

## How this works

A committee has documented a list of contributions primitives that have been deemed to be valuable to the RAID Token initiative.  Each of these contribution types have an associated point value.  

As contributors are accomplishing different contributions, they can record them via the self reporting bot.  These contributions are then verified by the initiative coordinators and submitted to this repo via a PR.

At the end of each week, we will use the submitted csv file to calculate the points that each member has earned.  These correspond to the relative amount of work you accomplished that week.  This becomes the basis for you reward payment. 

This of this as a continuous retroactive airdrop, but with the conditions to earn tokens being set proactively. 

## Distribution of rewards

At the end of each month, the stream will distribute RAID Token to any members that have earned governance points.  The amount of RAID received is the porportional amount of the RAID budget that matches your share of the governance points.  
- For instance, if you have earned 2% of the governance points this month, you will earn 2% of the monthly allocated RAID Ops Budget. 

## Understanding the Repo

This repo has two important files to be aware of:
1. Activity Types:  This csv file contains the list of predetermined contributions and their associated point value.  Anyone is allowed to make a change or update this via the PR process to this repo.  
2. Activity History:  This csv has the running list and activity history of all the contributions made by guild members to the RAID Token Initiative.  You can view the engagements you've made in this file, and submit any updates or corrections by making a PR against the file. 

For any questions on this process, come ask it in the #sustainable-ops channel in the RG Discord.
